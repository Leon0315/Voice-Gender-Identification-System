# Voice-Gender-Identification-System
Project from Music Information Retrieval class.

A python program that will take a voice sample file and output the gender of the voice by calculating the voice feature and predict the gender using decision tree and SVC classifier.

Need to install tkinter, numpy, matplotlib,sklearn libraries before running the code. Voice features were calculated using Marsyas developed by George Tzanetakis. More information can be found at : http://marsyas.info
